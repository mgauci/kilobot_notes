Using Eclipse and WinAVR to Program Kilobots
============================================
*Author: Melvin Gauci; melvin.gauci@gmail.com*

This document describes how to set up the Eclipse IDE to program Kilobots using the WinAVR toolchain on Windows.

**NOTE:** If you're new to the Kilobot platform, you're advised to **[use the online Kilobot editor](https://www.kilobotics.com/editor)**, instead of going through the process below. This process is only worth the trouble for people who'll be working with the Kilobot platform extensively and would like to use a more comprehensive IDE.

1. Installing WinAVR
--------------------

1.1. [Download](http://winavr.sourceforge.net/) and install WinAVR. During installation, accept the option to install Programmer’s Notepad.

1.2. If you’re running certain versions of Windows (certainly 8.1, and apparently Vista) you’ll need to replace a DLL in the WinAVR installation directory (a bug that's described [here](http://www.avrfreaks.net/forum/windows-81-compilation-error)). [Download](http://www.madwizard.org/download/electronics/msys-1.0-vista64.zip) and extract this DLL, and copy it to `/utils/bin` under your WinAVR installation directory. When prompted if you want to replace the current DLL, accept.

2. Building Kilolib
-------------------

2.1. [Download](https://github.com/acornejo/kilolib) Kilolib and extract the zipped file.

> You now need to build Kilolib, and it’s easiest to do this using the Programmer’s Notepad IDE. There's no need to create a project; you just need to point the IDE to the Kilolib directory, and it will execute the Makefile that's in there.

2.2. In Programmer’s Notepad, click `File -> Open`, navigate to the Kilolib directory and open the file `blank.c`. 

2.3. Click `Tools > Make All`.

> If all goes well, you should get: `Process Exit Code: 0`. The built files are now found under `/build` in your Kilolib directory. The static library is the file `kilolib.a`.

3. Installing Eclipse and Plugins
---------------------------------
> First, you need to have Eclipse installed with C/C++ support (the CDT plugin).

3.1. If you don’t plan to use Eclipse for Java development, you can directly download and install the [Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers](http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/lunasr2) version. In this case, skip the next step.

3.2. Alternatively, if you already have Eclipse installed, but not the CDT plugin, install it by following the instructions [here](http://eclipse.org/cdt/downloads.php).

> Next, you need to install the AVR Eclipse plugin. Note that [this does NOT include an AVR toolchain](http://avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/The_AVR_GCC_Toolchain) (compiler, linker, etc.), which is why you installed WinAVR.

3.3. Install the AVR Eclipse plugin by following the instructions [here](http://avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Plugin_Download).
 
4. Setting Up an Eclipse Project
--------------------------------
> Now for the slightly grueling part. You'll set up an Eclipse project from scratch with the correct settings to build Kilobot programs. Once you’ve finished, you should probably (read: certainly) make a copy of this ‘clean’ project as a boilerplate, so you don’t have to repeat this procedure every time you start a new project.

### Creating the Project

4.1. Open Eclipse and select a workspace (e.g. create a directory on your desktop for handiness).

4.2. Click `File > New > C Project`. In the dialog, give your project a name (here we'll assume it's `Kilobot`) and under `Project Type`, select `AVR Cross Target Application > Empty Project`. Click `Next`.

4.3. You probably don’t need both Debug and Release configurations. Uncheck `Debug` and click `Next`.

4.4. In the next dialog (`AVR Target Hardware Properties`), under `MCU Type` select `ATmega328P`, and set the `MCU Frequency` to `8000000` Hz (8 MHz). Click `Finish`.

4.5. Create a new source file in your project by right clicking on the project's name `> New > Source File`. Give this new source file a name, e.g. `main.c`. Copy and paste into this file the code from `blank.c` found in the Kilolib directory. You’ll use this code to make sure everything is working (later, you’ll write your own programs in this file).

### Setting Header and Library File Paths

> You now need to provide Eclipse with paths to the Kilolib header (.h) and library (.a) files. Although you could set these paths to any directory on your machine, I recommend copying them into your Eclipse project directory. They're small enough, and this way your project is self-contained.

4.6. In your Eclipse project directory, create two new directories, and call them `include` and `lib`. (to create a new directory, right click on the project name `> New > Folder`). 

4.7. Copy *all* the .h files from the Kilolib directory into the `include` directory. 

4.8. Copy the kilolib.a file from /build in the Kilolib directory into the new `lib` directory. 

4.9. *Very importantly*, rename the kilolib.a file you just copied into the `lib` directory to `libkilolib.a` (i.e. prepend it with "lib"). This is because the linker expects all library files to start with "lib".

> You’ll now tell Eclipse where to look for the header and library files you just copied.

4.10. Right click on the project name and click `Properties`.  Go to `C/C++ Build -> Settings`. Under `Tool Settings` go to `AVR Compiler -> Directories`. Under `Include Paths (-I)` add a new path. Click `Workspace` and navigate to the `include` directory in your project.

4.11. Go to `AVR C Linker -> Libraries`. Under `Libraries Path (-L)` add a new path. Click `Workspace` and navigate to the `lib` directory in your project.

4.12. Under `Libraries (-l)` add a library and type: `kilolib`. The linker will automatically look for a file called `libkilolib.a`, which is why we renamed this file.

### Fixing a Silly Bug

> One last step. If you try building now and your coded uses any functions from the math library (math.h), you’ll get an error. This is due to a [bug](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=40215.0) - apparently Eclipse attempts to use the C++ library instead of the C one, and this causes a problem.

4.13. Go to `AVR C Linker` (this is one level above where you already are). Modify the `Command Line Pattern` to:
`${COMMAND}  -lc -lm ${FLAGS} ${OUTPUT_FLAG}${OUTPUT_PREFIX}${OUTPUT}  ${INPUTS}  -lc`.

5. Building Your Code and Uploading it to a Kilobot Robot
---------------------------------------------------------

5.1. Close the settings - you’re now good to go. Build the project by pressing `Ctrl+B` (or going to `Project -> Build All`). A `Release` directory will be created in your project, and this will contain the object code file (aka "hex file"), `Kilobot.hex`.

5.2. You can now upload the hex file onto your Kilobot robot using the [KiloGUI tool](https://github.com/acornejo/kilogui).

6. Closing Notes
----------------
When starting a new project, you might want to rename a copy of your boilerplate project. Apart from renaming the directory, you also need to open each of the files `.cproject` and `.project`, and do a Search and Replace operation from the old (boilerplate) project name to your desired new one.

Happy coding.
